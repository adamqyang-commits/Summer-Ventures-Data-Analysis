# An Analysis of Various Social Factors in Relation to Intergenerational Mobility

This repository contains the research paper and accompanying Python code for my 2023 Summer Ventures in Science and Mathematics (SVSM) project at UNC Charlotte.

## 📜 The Research Paper

**[View the Full Report: SVSM Research Report.pdf](SVSM%20Research%20Report.pdf)**

This paper analyzes the effect of two major factors on intergenerational mobility: parent income on child household income and parent education level on child education level.

## 🐍 The Code

The analysis was conducted using Python in Jupyter Notebooks, with `pandas`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, and `statsmodels`.

* **`Parent Income.ipynb`**: Contains the code to analyze USCB data on parent income percentile and child household income. This notebook generates the regression models and the plot seen in **Figure 1**.
* **`Parent Education Level.ipynb`**: Contains the code to analyze BLS and USCB data on educational attainment. This notebook includes the two-proportion z-tests and the regression models for **Figures 2 and 3**.

### A Note on This Code
The original `.ipynb` files for this project were lost. The notebooks in this repository are an AI-assisted reconstruction based on the methods, data tables, and figures documented in the final research report.
